                    <p>In accordance to our profit margins. Yeah, we make burgers.
                    And our burgers are tasty as hell. At Mino Burgers, we only
                    use the highest quality meat, bread, and vegetables that
                    our profit margins allowed. Can you believe that we actually
                    optimized our buns to have as much air as possible before
                    they're not considered bread anymore? It's hilarious. We're
                    literally charging you for air.</p>

                    <p>Keeping you and your family fed is no easy task. Here
                    at Mino Burgers, we put that into deep consideration when
                    crafting our recipes. Our burgers compromise a lot in terms
                    of quality to keep our prices low, but we'll tell you
                    otherwise because you're gullible as shit. Haha.</p>

                <h2>And the <span class="red-text">most convenience</span>.</h2>
                    <p>No one likes an inconvenient and frustrating food
                    experience. That's why we go out of our way to cut out
                    the excess from your restaurant experience and streamline
                    it for you. We got rid of our tables and chairs so that
                    you can't eat at our restaurants. The faster you get out
                    the more sales we can make. Also we won't need to hire
                    waiters or dishwashers. And we can make the buildings
                    smaller and pay less rent. This is hilarious.</p>
